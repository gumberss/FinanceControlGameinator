## What
Allow players to receive and spend money. 

## Why
The players can buy properties and companies from the bank or even from other players, as well as the "Habeas Corpus" and "Free buy" cards founded in Luck/Setback, if it is with other player.

## How
Giving to the player the ability to spend and receive money 

## Limits
The account at this moment is not so sophisticated, so neither the transactions. If more than one player is involved in the operation, all the players need to make the operation in their accounts. 
For example:
- If a player buys some property from the bank, the player needs to spend money in the app and that is it.
- If a player buys some property from another player, the buyer player should inform the "spend money" operation in his account and the seller player needs to inform the "receive money" operation in his account
- If a player needs to pay rent to another player, the player who have the property should inform the "receive money" operation in his account and the other player needs to inform the "spend money" operation in his account
