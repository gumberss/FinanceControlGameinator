## Motivation
I like to play Monopoly, it is an interesting game that make you think how you can have a healthy financial life, not only for you, but for your friends and kids. But this game doesn't have some interesting features that a game like this could have, giving some insights, and increasing the benefit of knowledge shared between the players.

On the other hand, thinking in the systems' architectures, designs and code, I have some knowledge and there are some interesting things I'm learning at this moment, reading books, articles, that I'd like to document and share.

So it motivates me to create my own financial game, with an easy setup, a game flow as automated as possible, building a game easy to play and understand the general concepts, keeping the player's focus on what is really important: the strategic they will build to have a healthy financial life.

## Monopoly
One of the better games I've ever seen is Monopoly, the purpose of this game is to remain financially solvent while forcing opponents into bankruptcy. This game has some features that make the players build a strategy to be financially stable for as much as possible.

### Why is hard to play?
When you start playing this game, you need to distribute the specific money to all the players, what is a little boring, actually, usually this setup is one of the things that makes the people don't want to start play the game, because it is a waste of time. 
After it, one person should be the bank, or one player needs to do this function while he is playing what can overwhelm him at the beginning. If you chose one player to be the bank, after some time the player won't do many things, because the bank won't have many properties to negotiate, so it's time to wait some player to start selling some properties to continue playing as the bank. If you chose a player to do the bank function while he is playing, at the beginning, the player will be overwhelming and over time you just stop playing the game because it is too late, and you need to save the game in the box.

### What could change?

There are a multitude of features we can add in this system, some of them I already thought of, others we will discover in the journey, and we're going to explore, detail, document and think much closer on many of them.

We can solve some o the problems mentioned early, creating a system that manage the game life-cycle, building the initial setup, managing the bank, and helping the players to manage theirs money and properties. But there are some features that Monopoly doesn't want to have, and I think it would be valuable to teach about financial life, some of them are: 
- Buy a property paying by installments with fee
- Invest the money the player have in some investment the bank can provide;
- Invest the money the player have in other players' properties;
- The player makes an IPO of his property;
- Events can happen during the game, like at the end of the "year", you can pay more expensive rent to be in properties in tourist places;
And so on...

Of course, at this moment all of them are only ideas, we need to explore them later.

## Vision 
Create a game that has the game-flow as automated as possible, enhancing the system and architecture in an incremental way, following some agile concepts, documenting each version, architecture, flows and trade-offs. Each version will have one or two features more, giving some business value as well as technical value.

It is expected some overengineering, but keep it simple in terms of costs. Following some principles, we're going to build an MVP as simple as possible, trying to use some free tools and enhancing over time, delaying the money spend as much as possible.

At the beginning, we're going to build a game that automates the Monopoly game, starting from the most important features that can decrease the waste time during the game, after some time, when the most of the Monopoly's features are already automated, we're going to start adding some new features that will teach all the players how to have a healthy financial life.
